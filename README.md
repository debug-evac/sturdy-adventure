# Placeholder Modpack

This is a little modpack (packwiz format) that I created and play with my friends on the latest (1.20.1) version of Minecraft. It is not great, probably pretty unbalanced and not recommended to be used by people, that I do not associate with.

No guarantees for upkeeping with updates and fixing (config or mod related) issues.
